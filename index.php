                                <p>An audit opinion pertains only to the financial audit conducted regularly by COA
                                    auditors on the agencies within its jurisdiction. It may be unmodified or modified,
                                    depending on whether an agency’s financial statements are prepared, in all material
                                    respects, in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework.</p>

                                <p>An unmodified opinion (also referred to as unqualified opinion) is issued when the
                                    auditor concludes
                                    that the financial statements are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance
                                    with the applicable
                                    financial reporting framework. Meanwhile, a modified opinion – includes qualified,
                                    adverse and disclaimer
                                    of opinion – is issued when the auditor concludes that, based on the audit evidence
                                    obtained, the financial
                                    statements as a whole are not free from material misstatement; or is unable to
                                    obtain sufficient
                                    appropriate audit evidence to conclude that the financial statements as
                                    a whole are free from material misstatement.</p>

                                <p>It is important to note that the financial statements represent only a facet of an
                                    agency and that
                                    an audit opinion does not provide any conclusions on the agency’s level of
                                    compliance with laws,
                                    rules and regulations, nor the application of the principles of economy, efficiency,
                                    and
                                    effectiveness in the agency’s operations. Such matters are covered by the compliance
                                    and
                                    performance audits, respectively, which are conducted by the COA in addition to

                                    audit. Results of these audits are found in the Annual Audit Reports and are
